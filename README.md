# obsidian-diary-merger

## 1 What is it?

An obsidian plugin

Plugin functionality: **automatically/manually** merge or append multiple diary files into one or more merge files according to a threshold and number of entries.

## 2 Why

My pain point:

I was using obsidian journaling as todo management via task, dataview, etc., but gradually I found a problem, my daily todo may only be 3 or 4 entries, **but I have hundreds of journal files** (one journal a day).

Of course, you can maintain a file, in which to write todo, not to mention that it looks messy, has been in a file to write, write more or to slowly scroll down, the most important thing is that, just click on the diary button, you can write in a brand new file, the feeling of superb have wood ~!

So, I need a plugin to automatically merge my previous diary entries (notes completed or unfinished todo's also need to be queried) into one file!

## 3 How it works

Please refer to: [Plugin: Diary Merger Documentation.md](https://github.com/lspzc/obsidian-diary-merger/blob/v-1.1.0-bata/documentation/插件: Diary Merger Documentation.md)
